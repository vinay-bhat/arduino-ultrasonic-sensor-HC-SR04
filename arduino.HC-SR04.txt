This is a simple guide on how to make a distance detector using an Arduino, a HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor,LED's.The ultimate goal of this tutorial is to use the LED's to display how far the object is from the ultrasonic sensor.

Components Used:
1.Arduino Uno 1x
2.LED 2x
3.HC-SR04 Sensor 1x (http://letsmakerobots.com/node/30209)
4.Breadboard
5.Jumper Wires
6.Resistors 220 ohm  2x


*DISCLAIMER*
Resistors are not absolutely necessary for the build, however the are highly recommended to be used.
